# [Request Header Parser Microservice](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/request-header-parser-microservice)

This is a header parser microservices project for Free Code Camp Backend Development Course.

The base code is from the Request Header Parser Microservice Boilerplate linked above. I added the routing necessary to complete the user stories for the challenge. I also added a few tweaks to the landing page content and styling.
